# Cache Action

Save and restore files as a cache in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Use this action to cache dependencies or build outputs to speed up GitHub Actions workflows.

By default, this action will attempt to restore files from a cache if it exists; otherwise, it will save files to a cache at the end of the workflow run.
